 Allows intercepting a network response to repeat the original request if necessary.
 The `predicate` of the processor should return whether or not the request should be repeated, but should also contain the work necessary that allows the repeated request to pass successfully to avoid further repetitions. Returning false will cause the processor to allow the response process to continue normally.
