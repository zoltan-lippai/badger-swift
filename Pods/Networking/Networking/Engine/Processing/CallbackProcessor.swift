/**
 A simple processor unit executed as last in the response processing chain. It helps the engine to determine how to finish the processing flow:
 * allows dropping the response causing the completion block to not be invoked at all
 * allows repeating the original request and calling the original completion once it has finished successfully. This assumes the repeated request won't fail the same way the first attempt did.
 * allows calling back the original completion block normally
